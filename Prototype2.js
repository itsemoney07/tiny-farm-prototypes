// Placeholder for Prototype 2 core logic.
// This connects your React build to the Tiny Farm UI and will later
// render sprites, handle save/load, shop logic, and play sounds.

// TODO: import or paste the React component code from Prototype 1,
// then upgrade tiles → sprites, add shop(), save(), and sound effects.
